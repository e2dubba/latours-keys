# Modeling Actor Network Theory 

* Bruno Latour's Actor Network Theory is a illuminating system for
  investigating society and technology 
* The insight that import actors in a network are both human and non-human is
  vitally important for understanding systems. 
* Especially given that these networks are rarely directly human to human, but
  mediated through non-human actors. 
* By creating an ontological model for doing actor network theory analysis, we
  can create a shape and a structure that can provide a more robust framework
to hang actor network analysis 
* Ontologies provide a robust, usable, and versiatle framework for doing
  this kind of analysis. 
* By using the open specifications of RDF, OWL, and SKOS, we can create a
  usable, useful, and functioning model for Actor Network Analysis that can
give non-human actants (maybe we should use this term) the prominance they
deserve in this system.
