# Latour's Keys

## Purpose

Bruno Latour, with the help of others, proposed an approach to the sociology of
science that received the label Actor Network Theory. This methodology has much
to commend itself, however, we think it could be improved with the tools that
are used by ontologist and the technology that enables linked data.

## A Working Example

An initial ontology is available
[here](https://e2dubba.github.io/latours-keys/ontology/v1). This will be
updated until the time we present the paper, and in time, we will create a
working ontology to use ANT to approach other sociological studies.

In the process of creating the Ontology, we also created a shapes file,
available [at this link](https://e2dubba.github.io/latours-keys/shapes/latours_keys.shapes.html).

The data file is [available here at this
link](https://e2dubba.github.io/latours-keys/data/latours_keys.data.html).
